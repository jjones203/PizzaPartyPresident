Year Stepping Dependencies

1) Change tiles' temp & precipitation values
    Requires:
    - previously interpolated values for each tile

2) Add noise to tiles' temp & precipitation values (random 10% of tiles + tiles within 100km of those tiles)
    Requires:
    - scenario's randomization percentage
    - distance calculation

3) Calculate sea level rise & its effects
    Requires:
    - scenario's base sea level rise/year
    - scenario's randomization percentage
    - info on which tiles are currently coastline and their elevations
    -> determine which tiles are underwater; set them as ocean or null
    -> remove those tiles' areas from their country's arable land area (also total land area?)
   
4) Allocate crops to tiles
    Requires: 
    - the updated climate data for each tile
    - what was planted in each tile in prior year
    - ideal ranges for each crop
    - each country's yield for each crop (set at start of game)
    - user's allocation of land for each crop at start of year
    - optimization algorithm
 
 5) Calculate crop production
    Requires:
    - starting yields
    - how many ideal, acceptable, and poor tiles have been allocated to each crop
        (or, look up which tiles have each crop and then look up whether ideal, etc.?)
    
7) Trading: which crops get imported/exported, how much

8) Calculate food available
    Requires:
    - crop production
    - import/export info

9) Calculate countries' death rate
    Requires:
    - 2014 death rate
    - population in prior year
    - number of malnourished people in prior year
    - 2014 number of malnourished people
    
10) Calculate current population*
    Requires:
    - 2014 birthrate and migration
    - prior year population
    - current year death rate
    * think equation in spec is wrong, need to check
    
11) Calculate undernourished %
    Requires:
    - amount of each crop available
    - current year population
    - 2014 need per capita for each crop
    
12) Calculate happy people
    Requires:
    - current population
    - prior year population
    - current death rate
    - prior year death rate
    - current undernourished %
    - prior year undernourished %


climate & crops chain of dependency:  
1 -> (2 & 3) -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8

population chain of dependency:
9 -> 10

happiness chain of dependency:
(8 & 10) -> 11 -> 12

Climate & crops chain and population chain are independent.
Happiness chain depends on both of them.
